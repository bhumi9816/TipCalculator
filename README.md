# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Bhumi Patel**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [Yes] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [Yes] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [Yes] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [Yes] A tip slider which allows users to adjust their tip amount with a minimum of 3 percentage upto 30 percentage using UISlider and using "Calculate" button can independently calculate the new slider tip amount

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- The app building went smoothly especially with the walkthrough steps.
- However, when I decided to implement tip slider, there were minor setbacks connecting the new feature while maitaining the previous work, conversion and making sure all the outlets were connected with the app feature.
- Other than that the app went great. I learned a lot and I am looking forward to learning and creating more in the future.
